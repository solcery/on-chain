## Project description

Solcery is a collectible card game built on Solana. All game logic is being processed on-chain, every card is NFT stored in player wallets, and each meaningful action is a transaction. We encourage development of user generated content blockchain games so each card is manually crafted by players. They combine basic game logic bricks to create unique card behaviour, and add name, picture and description to it to fully customize their collections.

This project is a submission for Solana Season Hackathon (May 15th - June 7th).

You can play it yourself <a href = "https://solcery.herokuapp.com">[here]</a>, or watch a video <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibFnwq9eAxM">[here]</a>

### Create

Create your own card with in-game node editor. 
Card data is serialized in binary format and stored for each unique mint.
